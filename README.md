# FilterSFBlogPosts
This repository comes as a solution for filtering Sitefinity blog posts by multiple months and dates

### Filter blog posts sample

Sitefinity provides an amazingly quick and easy-to-use way to create blog posts via the Blogs content module. Naturally once you have more blog posts, you would want to display archive so that users could find older posts. Out-of-the-box there is an Archive widget that you could use to filter blog posts. You can use it to pick up the blog posts that are published on a specific day, month and year or just year.

In some cases you may want to display blog posts filtered by multiple dates of publication. This repository contains the code for filtering blog posts by multiple years and dates.
